# FORM + CODE

I worked on an interactive piece where I wanted the
piece to create something reminiscent of two doors (representing choice)
when the mouse is dragged. When the dragging stops, and a click is
registered, the word STOP appears somewhere. I wanted to comment on the
difficulty of making a choice sometimes and how you might be overthinking
rather than stopping and doing something.  I found using interactive art rather
than generative art worked better for this message.
